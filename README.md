# Unchecked Exception in Scala

This repository demonstrates a common Scala coding error: an unhandled `IllegalArgumentException`.

The `MyClass` example shows a method that throws an exception without any handling. This can lead to unexpected program termination.

The solution demonstrates how to improve the code by either handling the exception or making the method safer by preventing such cases.
